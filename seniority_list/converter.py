    '''Convert data relating to job assignment conditions from basic job
    level inputs to enhanced job level inputs

    Inputs are the basic job level values for the various conditions, the
    job dictionary, and the distribution methods used during conversion.

    This function is called within the build_program_files script when the
    "enhanced_job" key value within the settings dictionary is set to "True".

    inputs
        job_dict (dictionary)
            case_specific jd variable.  This input contains full-time job
            level conversion percentages
        sg_list (list)
            case-specific sg_rights variable
        ratio_list (list)
            case-specific ratio_cond variable
        ratio_dict (dictionary)
            dictionary containing ratio condition data
        count_ratio_dict (dictionary)
            dictionary containing all data related to a capped ratio or
            count ratio condition
        dist_sg, dist_ratio, dist_count (string)
            options are: 'split', 'full', 'part'

            determines how jobs are distributed to the enhanced job levels.

            'split' - distribute basic job count to full- and part-time
            enhanced job levels according to the ratios set in the job
            dictionary (jd) variable

            'full' - distribute basic job count to corresponding enhanced
            full-time job levels only

            'part' - distribute basic job count to corresponding enhanced
            part-time job levels only.  This option could be selected if the
            employees with special job rights are placed in a relatively low
            position on the integrated list, eliminating the option of
            obtaining a full-time job position

            The distribution type for each condition input is independent of
            the other condition distributions.

            If these variables are not assigned, the program will default
            to "split".
